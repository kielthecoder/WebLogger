# WebLogger

Use a websocket connection to print logs from VC-4 programs.  This is the program created in my blog post at https://kielthecoder.com/2021/04/13/vc-4-websockets/.

### Dependencies

In order to build the example program, you'll need a copy of WebsocketServer.dll from the Control Concepts Websocket Server Lite demo program.  Instructions on how to get this are detailed in the blog post.
