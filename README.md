# WebLogger

Use a websocket connection to print logs from VC-4 programs.  This is the program created in my blog post at https://kielthecoder.com/2021/04/13/vc-4-websockets/.

I've updated the code to use the websocket-sharp package, and you can find the details at https://kielthecoder.com/2021/04/16/vc-4-websocket-sharp/.
